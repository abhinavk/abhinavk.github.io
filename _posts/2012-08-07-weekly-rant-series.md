Although London-Olympics are halfway, India may have completed her medals tally. The USA/China-duo will lead the medal tally but we, Indians will be celebrating this Olympic being their most successful campaign ever. Even after more than 60 years of independence and 100 years of participation in Olympics, we have only won 22-or-so medals yet. Let me remind you, this number is lot less than what USA has won in <s>almost</s> every Olympics. The slant rise of China in the recent years is even more surprising. 25 years ago, they were down there in single-digits and now…they are right at the top of the table competing with USA for the gold-crown. It may also be attributed to their Soviet/East Germany-inspired sports policy. Despite having a completely different political system, I don’t think it was any harder for Indian government’s Sports ministry to undertake a similar program if it was not for the retired politicians/bureaucrats who treat sports federations like any of their hobbies. Almost all national parties have a plethora of leaders who are chairmen or members of sports councils and I ensure none of them have any intermediate understanding of the game they administer.
