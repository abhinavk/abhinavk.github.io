Apart from a few lucky ones (including me), people are not being able to turn off Safety mode on YouTube. So here&#8230;how to do it. (Yeah! It&#8217;s really that simple)

3/4 Steps:

1.  <span style="line-height: 13px;">Open <a title="YouTube SSL" href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank"><strong>https</strong>://www.youtube.com</a></span>
2.  Turn off **Safety Mode**. (It&#8217;s at the bottom)
3.  Now always open YouTube via SSL ie <a title="YouTube SSL" href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank"><strong>https</strong>://www.youtube.com</a>
4.  Or install **&#8216;HTTPS Anywhere**&#8216; extension and add youtube.com to it.
