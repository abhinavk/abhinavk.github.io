*Disclaimer: This is just a summarization. Do please read the actual license before deciding on one for your own projects.*

I have always been very curious about the state of software licenses in India. Although we all can agree that no consumer has ever read a license or EULA in its entirety and most Indians do not even know that something like these exist. For them. software is usually provided by their local **Computer Solutions** shop for a meagre sum of money or by more technically advanced friends who usually get them off the P2P networks. Moroever, the Information Technology laws here are laughablly unenforceable.

So to make your computing lives a little harder, I am summarizing some of the most popular licenses (mostly open-source ones) so that if you happen to come by any of these, you'll have an idea of what are you dealing with.


1. **GPLv2 (GNU General Public License v2)**

    You may replicate and change the subject as long you keep all changes also under GPL2. If you are using third-party GPL code in your program, you MUST also open up the source code.

    * You must include the original license.
    * You must disclose the source code.
    * You may modify.
    * You may distribute.

    * You cannot hold the license owner liable for damages.


2. **GPLv3 (GNU General Public License v3**

    You may replicate and change the subject as long you keep all changes also under GPL2. If you are using third-party GPL code in your program, you MUST also open up the source code. You must also track all the changes or modification timestamps of all source files. It's quite similar to GPLv2 but the devil is in the details.

    * You must include the original license.
    * You must disclose the source code.
    * You must state all the changes done.
    * You may modify.

    * You cannot hold the license owner liable for damages.


3. **LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License)**

    You may copy and modify the subject as long as the modifications done by you are also licensed under LGPL. Derived statically-linked works must be under LGPL while non-statically-linked projects are exempted from this restriction.

    * You must include the original license.
    * You must non-statically link the libraries.
    * You may modify the software.
